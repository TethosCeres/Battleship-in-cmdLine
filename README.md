The DoNotEdit.txt is how the game is storing the gamestate as you are playing.
While fine to edit, if needed, outside of active play, because the code resets the file at the begining of every game, it is ill advised.

The template.txt file explains how to create your own game board, but to reiterate, the template is NOT the board that is imported into the live game.
That file is Battleship.txt. The template.txt serves as a QOL file so you don't have to count out gameboard spaces when you make your own board.

Battleship.txt is the board that will be imported into the live game, this is where you will set up the board for play by a friend. Unless of course, you make your own board
and then play it by yourself to feel accomplished.
